-- WezTerm can set both -- set_position, maximize -- but can read neither: a
-- GuiWindow's get_dimensions reports pixel_width, pixel_height, dpi and
-- is_full_screen, and there is no get_position at all. So the values have to
-- come from Windows itself, via GetWindowPlacement.
--
-- That costs a PowerShell process, which is why this is off by default and only
-- runs on periodic and manual saves, never on the event-driven ones that fire
-- whenever a tab is opened. Compiling the interop takes about a second, so it is
-- cached as an assembly and merely loaded on later calls.
--
-- Only ever one window. Get-Process exposes MainWindowHandle, and WezTerm gives
-- Lua no way to map a GuiWindow to an OS window handle, so with two windows open
-- there is no telling which handle belongs to which. Rather than guess, capture
-- nothing.
